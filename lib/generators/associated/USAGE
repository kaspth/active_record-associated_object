Description:
    Create a PORO collaborator associated object inheriting from `ActiveRecord::AssociatedObject` that's associated with an Active Record record class.

    It'll be associated on the record with `has_object`.

    Note: associated object names support pluralized class names. So "Seats" remain "seats" in all cases, and "Seat" remains "seat" in all cases.
Example:
    bin/rails generate associated Organization::Seats

    This will create:
        app/models/organization/seats.rb
        test/models/organization/seats_test.rb

    And in Organization, this will insert:
      has_object :seats
